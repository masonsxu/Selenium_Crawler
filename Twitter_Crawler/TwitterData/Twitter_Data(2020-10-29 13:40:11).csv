Meghan is a self-made woman who doesn't have to kowtow to anyone esp. those racist & misogynistic vipers in the royal family. The Sussexes made the best decision of their lives when they moved to the US far away from the toxicity on that vile island.

You're removing the meaning of racist whenever you use it in a disingenuous manner.

99,Psycho Mantis,@OompaMantis11,上午6:00 · 2020年10月1日,What is that supposed to mean? California was admitted to the union as a free state. Why should we pay for something none of us had anything to do with? Is it right to tax immigrants? Is it right to tax descendants of union soldiers? Nothing racist about opposing this nonsense.
100,Patty Hajdu,@PattyHajdu,下午10:43 · 2020年9月30日,This kind of sexism and racism is unacceptable in our society and unacceptable in Canada. Canadians deserve better from Mr. Sloan and Mr. O’Toole.
101,MindOverChatter,@comeragewithme,上午3:43 · 2020年10月1日,"You have clearly demonstrated you are confused about the term racism. You chose to put Canadians at risk instead of protecting us from being exposed because it was ""racist"" to close our borders to countries with COVID outbreaks."
102,Nicky Clark,@MrsNickyClark,上午6:22 · 2020年10月1日,Should be absolutely no conflict between the signatories of this letter also signing the letter calling out the verbal abuse & harassment of JK Rowling. The idea that defending her against online abuse is an “attack on trans & non binary people” is false.
103,Kevyne  #SexNotGender,@KevyneShandris,上午7:04 · 2020年10月1日,"This is like being a willing witness of watching a public lynching. They don't care as it doesn't affect their tribe politics. Add the money involved, it's buttering the bread on both sides. I experienced the same thing with racism in the South in the 1970s, too. Us vs Them junk."

It will be deportation or worse for Mr Ahmari & his family
105,Christy O'My,@christyo_my,上午5:17 · 2020年10月1日,"Your comment is so racist!  Just b/c his name looks different than a ‘normal’ American name, u assume he is not American. He very well may have been born here or taking the steps to become a US citizen. There are plenty of people who want to be here & achieve legit citizenship."
